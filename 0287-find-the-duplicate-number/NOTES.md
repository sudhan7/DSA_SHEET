â€‹Using fast and slow pointer
The array will be represented as linked list 
When the slow and fast pointer are equal
It forms a loop in linked list
Then set the slow to zero 
Now move the slow and fast pointer with the same speed
When they are equal return the slow which will be the duplicate element.
